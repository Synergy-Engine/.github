Synergy is an extremely modular game engine written in Rust following the ECS pattern. It is meant to be really modular, but still robust and flexible, so you can add your own systems and components to it, or even use some modules of the engine as a base for your own.

Check out [our website](https://Synergy-Engine.github.io) for resources to get started, docs and a blog in case you're interested.


## Engine Modules (Crates)

Synergy is designed with modularity at its core. Each significant component lives in its own dedicated repository within this organization:

* **[synergy-core](https://github.com/Synergy-Engine/synergy-core)**: The heart of the engine. Implements ECS and other fundamental utilities.
* **[synergy-error](https://github.com/Synergy-Engine/synergy-error)**: Handles errors across the engine.
* *More stuff coming soon!*


## Other Repos (Non-Engine)

These repositories are not a part of the engine.

* **[brand-assets](https://github.com/Synergy-Engine/brand-assets)**: A place to store all brand assets such as logos, banners, and documentation.
* **[web](https://github.com/Synergy-Engine/web)**: Synergy's official website, with documentation and a blog.


## Community & Contributing

We hope to build a cool community around Synergy!

* **Discussions**: Have a question, want to suggest an idea, or just chat about game dev? Join our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Synergy-Engine/synergy-core/discussions).
